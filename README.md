# The-Most-Dangerous-Writing-App--GUI-
  For most writers, a big problem is writing block. Where you can't think of what to write and you can't write anything.
  One of the most interesting solutions to this is that application (The Most Dangerous Writing App),  where if you stop writing, all your progress will be lost.
  A timer will count down and when the program detects the user has not written anything in the last 5 seconds, it will delete all the text they've written so far.
