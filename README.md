# The Most Dangerous Writing App

The Most Dangerous Writing App is a tool designed to help writers focus on their writing by providing a minimalist interface and a countdown timer that encourages them to keep typing. The app's name is a reference to the idea that it can be addictive and time-consuming, as writers may be motivated to keep writing in order to avoid letting the countdown timer reach zero.

## Features

- Minimalist interface with a single button and a canvas
- Countdown timer that resets if the user continues typing
- Text entry field to type in
- Canvas background changes when the user starts writing

## Usage

To use the app, simply click the "START" button to begin writing. The button will disappear and the canvas background will change to a different image. A text entry field will appear within the canvas, and a countdown timer will begin counting down from four seconds. If the user continues typing, the countdown timer will reset to four seconds and start counting down again. If the user stops typing for more than three seconds, the countdown timer will reset to four seconds and begin counting down again. If the countdown timer reaches zero, the text entry field will be destroyed and the button and original canvas background will be displayed again.

## Benefits

- Can help writers overcome writer's block or procrastination by providing a sense of urgency and a limited amount of time to write
- May be helpful for writers who struggle with maintaining focus and concentration while writing
- Minimalist interface helps to minimize distractions
